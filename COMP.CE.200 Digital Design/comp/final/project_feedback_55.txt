Project was interesting and a bit hard at the beginning but after getting used to 
syntax of the HDL Designer it got easier to use the software. Some of the solutions 
were much more simplier than we initially thought of doing them. After using state 
machines in the exercises, the drawing of state machine diagrams became much clearer. 
At first the hierarchial designing seemed a bit confusing but as we in the later exercises
noticed it was a must. Overall the project was fun to do and it was nice to see it in live,
altough we only did basic version of the game.
